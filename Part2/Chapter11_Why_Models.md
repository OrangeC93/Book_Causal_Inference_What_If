## 11.2 Parametric estimators of the conditional mean
A parametric conditional mean model is, through its a **priori restrictions**, adding information to compensate for the lack of sufficient information in the data.

## 11.3 Nonparametric estimators of the conditional mean

A nonparametric estimators of the conditional mean function as those that produce estimates from the data **without any a priori restrictions** on the conditional mean function. Generally, the model is saturated whenever the number of parameters in a conditional mean model is equal to the number of unknown conditional means in the population.

All methods for causal inference that we described in Part I of this book–standardization, IP weighting, stratification, matching–were based on nonparametric estimators of population quantities under a saturated model because they did not impose any a priori restrictions on the value of the effect estimates.
