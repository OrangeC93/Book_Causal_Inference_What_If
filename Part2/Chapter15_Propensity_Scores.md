## 15.2 Propensity scores
Propensity score: π(L) measures the propensity of individuals to receive treatment given the information available in the covariates L. If the distribution of π(L) were the same for the treated A = 1 and the untreated A = 0, then there would be no confounding due to L, i.e., there would be no open path from L to A on a causal diagram.


Under exchangeability and positivity within levels of the propensity score π(L), the propensity score can be used to estimate causal effects using stratification (including outcome regression), standardization, and matching.
