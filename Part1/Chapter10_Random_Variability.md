There are two qualitatively different reasons why causal inferences may be wrong: systematic bias and random variability. The previous three chapters described three types of systematic biases: 
- Selection bias, measurement bias， both of which may arise in observational studies and in randomized experiments
- Unmeasured confounding, which is not expected in randomized experiments

## 10.1 Identification vs estimation
Identification problems: we can assume the size of the study population is effectively infinite.

A Wald confidence interval centered at pˆ is only guaranteed to be valid in large samples. For simplicity, here we assume that our sample size is sufficiently large for the validity of our Wald interval.
